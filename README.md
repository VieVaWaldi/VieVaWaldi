Currently working on an AI that learns to play 3D first person shooters. I dont commit all that often when I work on my own though. 

### tl;dr me

I love to build everything and i love it even more to combine that with AI, especially RL. Currently working as a Freelancer and writing my master thesis at the FSU Jena.
